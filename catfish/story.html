            <p>Have you ever been on the Oskil River, which flows through our Kharkiv Oblast to the Siverskyi Donets? You haven't? Then you should visit!</p>
            <p>The floodplain of the Oskil River, where it splits into several narrow branches at this point, is overgrown with thick reeds, kuga, bay willows, and thick, green juicy grass.</p>

            <p>Between the reeds and the willow tree, there are lots and lots of small ponds covered with thick green rushes and water lilies with yellow-hot flowers on long green whips! And how many water lilies there are! Those small lakes are connected to each other by narrow channels, so narrow that it is barely possible to push through them on a small dugout canoe from one small lake to another.</p>
            <p>The magical river Oskil... And how many wild ducks there are! If you happen to be lucky enough to visit those places in the spring or summer, get on a dugout boat and sail quietly, quietly, so that your oar neither splashes nor bubbles...</p>

            <p>Just across the state farm, the river in Oskil is broad; the water is very clean. A little to the left is a deep river hole, a whole sheer pit with calm water above. - There is such a depth that you can't even reach the bottom! No one has ever reached the bottom there! More than that! It is so deep there that our bell tower will dive! Such depth there! This is what Grandfather Panko told us.</p>

          <div id="text-4-b" class="text-4-b hide">
            <p>- God forbid you swim there! It draws in, deeply draws in! It will spin you, whirl you, plop—and there is no man!</p>

          <div id="text-4-b-2" class="text-4-b-2 hide">
            <p>- And what is that  twisting and whirling, grandfather? It's as if it's quiet on the surface.

          <div id="text-4-c" class="text-4-c hide">
            <p>— But it seems to be quiet on the surface, but it whirls under water. And twists and turns! But that's still nothing! Catfishes live there! There lived such a catfish; save, Lord, and have mercy!</p>

            <p>It's already dusk... Geese are swimming. A large flock of master's geese is floating! When the goose screams - geh-geh-geh-geh! —and hits on the water with wings lop-lop-lop! The geese all scattered, screaming! That goose once again — geh! — and with its wings — slap! - and there is no more goose! Dived under the water!</p>

            <p>And at the place where the goose was, something slapped on the water like a black shovel! Alas! Only the waves went away with the water. I just: "Holy Christ! Devil, sir, devil!" And the master shouted: "Give me the gun! The catfish swallowed the goose!" What gun? Will the gun ever reach there and shoot to such depths? The goose was gone! There was such catfish!</p>

            <p>- Did the catfish swallow the goose?</p>

            <p>- Do not believe? Haven't you read Sabaneev's books? My master read it to me.

            <p>So in those books, it is written that a catfish weighing four hundred kilograms was once caught! What a catfish he is! Not a catfish, but a cow! So you think he won't swallow the goose? But listen to what happened next with that catfish.
