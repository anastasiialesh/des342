                <h2> Ostap Vyshnya</h2>
                <h3>(1889-1956)</h3>
                <p>Ostap Vyshnya (real name - Pavlo Mykhailovych Gubenko) is a novelist, satirist, founder of the "smile" genre in Ukrainian literature, editor and screenwriter of VUFKU, a member of the "Plow" and "Hart" literary associations, an officer of the medical service of the Ukrainian National People's Republic.

                The writer was born on November 13, 1889, in the village of Chechva, in the Poltava region, in a large family. After graduating from the Kyiv military paramedic school in 1907, for some time he worked as a paramedic in the Russian army and in the surgical department of the South-Western Railway hospital. In 1917, Pavlo Gubenko entered the Kyiv University, but dropped out very soon.
                    
                From 1918, he served in the Army of the Ukrainian People's Republic in the medical units, where he quickly gained the rank of head of the medical and sanitary department of the Ministry of Railways of the Ukrainian People's Republic. In 1919, he was captured by the Bolsheviks and was imprisoned in Kharkiv until 1921.</p>

                <p>The writer's first printed work is published under the pseudonym "P. Grunsky" in the newspaper "Narodna Volya" on November 2, 1919. This is "Denikin's Democratic Reforms (Feuleton. It cannot be material for the constitution)." Later, in the same publication, Pavlo Gubenko publishes several more feuilletons, but active creative activity develops from April 1921, when the writer starts working in the newspaper "Visti VUCVK". Oleksandr Dovzhenko worked there for some time with him, who, in addition to journalistic activities, draws cartoons and caricatures. Artists develop friendly relationships, so Gubenko repeatedly writes scathing pamphlets about the artist's satirical drawings. And under the pseudonym Ostap Vyshnya, the writer signs for the first time under the feuilleton "Crazy, for God's sake!" July 22, 1921 in Selyanska Pravda. Already in 1924, he published the collection "Cherry Smiles (Rural)", thus establishing a new humorous genre.

                After, in 1924, writers from such literary groups as "Plow" and "Hart" began to be attracted to work in the editorial sector of VUFKU, Ostap Vyshnya became a participant in the film process: he acted as an editor and screenwriter ("Bursaki", 1926 ); together with V. Polishchuk, D. Buzko, O. Dosvitny and other artists, heads the council of the "Collective of Directors, Writers and Screenwriters" (KORELIS), whose task is to distribute films of social and political themes.

                <p>Gradually, Ostap Vyshnya became one of the most popular writers of his time, but this did not help him avoid another arrest: in 1933, he was accused of counter-revolutionary and terrorist activities, after which he was sent to the Gulag. The writer managed to fully engage in literary work only after his release in 1943, when he luckily avoided being shot and returned to Kyiv. The years of the camps could not destroy Vyshny's writing talent: he wrote many more works, including the well-known "How to cook and eat wild duck soup" (1945), "Catfish" (1953), published the collection "Hunting Smiles" (1956). In 1955, a year before his death, Ostap Vyshnia was rehabilitated. The writer died on September 28, 1956.
