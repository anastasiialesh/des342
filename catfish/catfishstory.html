            <p>Have you ever been on the Oskil River, which flows through our Kharkiv Oblast to the Siverskyi Donets? You haven't? Then you should visit!</p>
            <p>The floodplain of the Oskil River, where it splits into several narrow branches at this point, is overgrown with thick reeds, kuga, bay willows, and thick, green juicy grass.</p>

            <p>Between the reeds and the willow tree, there are lots and lots of small ponds covered with thick green rushes and water lilies with yellow-hot flowers on long green whips! And how many water lilies there are! Those small lakes are connected to each other by narrow channels, so narrow that it is barely possible to push through them on a small dugout canoe from one small lake to another.</p>
            <p>The magical river Oskil... And how many wild ducks there are! If you happen to be lucky enough to visit those places in the spring or summer, get on a dugout boat and sail quietly, quietly, so that your oar neither splashes nor bubbles...</p>

            <p>Just across the state farm, the river in Oskil is broad; the water is very clean. A little to the left is a deep river hole, a whole sheer pit with calm water above. - There is such a depth that you can't even reach the bottom! No one has ever reached the bottom there!

            <p>Yes... we, with a master, or rather, the master and me, decided to catch that damned catfish! The master ordered the blacksmith to make a giant hook. So the blacksmith made the hook, sharpened it, and brought it to the master. "Well, Panko," the master asks me, "what are we going to bait that hook with?" — "Nothing is better," I say, "than a goose. The catfish," I say, "has already feasted on goose meat, and he will definitely go for the goose!"</p>

            <p>Late in the evening, we tied the hook on two ropes tied together, attached them to black poplar, and threw it into Oskil. Catfish, as you know, hunt for prey at night. During the day, a catfish can catch a hook only by accident. So we threw the goose into Oskil and sat on the shore above the shack. We sit and wait. The night is warm, moonlit. Quiet, quiet all around. You can only hear outside the garden how Khrystya, who grazed the master's cows, loudly calls out:

            <p>We sat there. I don't hear that kind of song, and the master doesn't hear it at all. He just asked: "Who sings it out like that?" — "I don't know," I say, "Sir, it's not from our people; it's someone from the farm going to the village through the meadow."

            <p>We are sitting, dozing off. The master held the ropes in his hand. And then it tugged with such a force! The master didn't let go of the hook. But it was pulling him! It was pulling him towards the water, into the water, pulls - and that's it! The master held the hook, and I held the master. "Let go," I shouted to the lord, "the hook is tied to the tree! It won't come off! Let go!" But the master said, "Nah, let it go! You have to play with it so that it gets tired!" So we played with the fish, and it kept jerking and tugging, and then it let go. And we kept playing with it, and the catfish kept jerking, and then it let go again. And we kept playing with it! We played with it and played with it!

                <p>Catfish is a very strong fish, mighty.
                    Catfish is a bottom-dwelling fish. It lives in a certain hole and almost never leaves it. Adult catfish. Juvenile catfish and catfish fry are more active; they roam the entire river and swim to other "streets."
                    What do catfish eat? Catfish eat fish, frogs, ducklings, goslings...
                    Catfish are best caught during warm summer months, at night.
                    Catfish can be caught on fishing rods, they can be caught on a spinning reel, and the big ones can be caught on special large hooks.
                    What bait to use for catfish? Worms, live bait, frogs, chunks of meat, etc.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <p>As you may have noticed from our story, the best bait for large catfish is a goose or a setter-gordon or brown or Himalayan bear. Catfish do not take a polar bear because it is a polar animal, and catfish prefer warm water and not very cold animals.
                    How to catch catfish?
                    It's very simple: bait the hook, sit, and wait. When it starts to bite, hook it. When you've hooked it, pull it out. Once you've pulled it out, take your knife and gut the catfish because there have been cases when interesting things have been found in the belly of a catfish: smoked sausage, boiled crawfish, and a couple of whole sprats. So, sometimes a catfish will bring you not only itself as a fresh and very tasty fish (if you fry it), but also a substantial cold appetizer.

            <p>Catfish is an interesting fish!
                According to pre-revolutionary fishing writers, catfish weighed up to four hundred kilograms and swallowed dogs and bears. It's possible that with the development of fishing, catfish will weigh a ton and swallow Simmental bulls and small tugboats...
                Anything is possible, although we, as fishing writers, don't really believe it. It's not appropriate for Soviet writers to exaggerate.
